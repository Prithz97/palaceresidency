                                <ul>
                                    <li>Your name, email address, home and business address, phone number, nationality and payment card information; and</li>

                                </ul>

                                <p>This information may be provided to us directly when you make a reservation through our reservation system, through our websites, directly at the hotel or through mobile applications. In some cases, we may receive this
                                    information from a third party, such as when you book through an online travel agency or hotel booking site.</p>

                                <p><strong>INFORMATION WE GET FROM YOUR USE OF THE SITE.</strong> We also collect information from you when you browse the Site, use our mobile applications or participate in certain services at the Hotel, such as wireless
                                    internet services. In these instances, information such as your country information, internet protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, media access control address and other characteristics about your system or device may
                                    be automatically collected. This information may be collected for functional purposes as well as to improve your experience when using these services. This information may also be used for aggregated trend and statistical

                                <p><strong>INFORMATION STORED ON YOUR COMPUTER (&ldquo;COOKIES&rdquo;).</strong> When you visit this Site, the Hotel may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a &quot;cookie&quot;
                                    or similar file and can help us maintain and improve this Site. A &quot;cookie&quot; is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.
                                    It functions as your identification card, recording such things as Internet addresses, passwords, and preferences. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. It cannot be

                                <p><strong>HOW WE USE THIS INFORMATION:</strong> We use the information collected from you primarily to fulfill your hotel reservation. Prior to your stay, this may include sending your information to the Hotel or sending
                                    you pre-stay communications. Following your stay, we may also send you post-stay communications and satisfaction surveys to get feedback on your experience.<br />

                                <p><strong>WHO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH:</strong> We will share your information with the Hotel you are staying at to fulfill your reservation. We may also share your information with third party service providers to
                                    provide services in relation to our business as well as to help us improve our products and services. For example, we might use a third party or a third party product for the purposes of market research and data analytics.

                                    offers about their own products and services to you. Any such parties will need to agree to comply with our privacy requirements before we provide them with information.<br />
                                    <br /> Aside from the purposes described above, we do not share your stay information with any other third parties unless we have your consent or under special circumstances, such as:</p>

                                </ul>

                                <p>There may be other times when we collect and use personal information, for example if you choose to participate in one of our competitions or sweepstakes, sign up to receive our newsletters or other special offers and promotions,
                                    download one of our mobile applications or participate in one of our other services. In these instances, we will collect information from you for running and administering the respective competition, sweepstakes or
                                    service that you have elected to participate in. The information collected may include personal details such as your name, address, and contact information, as well as certain demographic information. In each case,
                                    we will collect, use and secure your information in a manner consistent with the general principles set out in this Privacy Policy unless we tell you otherwise.</p>
