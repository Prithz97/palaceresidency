                                <p><strong>GOVERNING LAW.</strong>&nbsp;These Terms shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina, United States, without regard to its conflicts of law rules. The

                                    the Site, or Materials (including any claim that any provision of these Terms or Materials are invalid, illegal, or otherwise voidable or void), seeking as relief money damages and/or attorneys&rsquo; fees or other
                                    damages will be submitted for arbitration to the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). The Hotel shall have the right in a proper case to obtain temporary restraining orders, temporary or preliminary
                                    injunctive relief and/or declaratory relief (other than declarations with respect to the amount of money damages) from a court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>The arbitration proceedings shall be heard by one independent arbitrator who shall be an attorney or retired judge. The arbitration shall be held under then-existing Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA in the city where
                                    the Hotel is located. All matters within the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1, et seq.) will be governed by it and not by any state arbitration law. You and the Hotel waive any rights to maintain other
                                    available resolution processes for such disputes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes. You and the Hotel waive any right to a jury trial for such disputes. The rules in arbitration
                                    are different from the rules that apply in court. There is no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in the Terms, as
                                    a court would.</p>

                                <p>In reaching his or her decision, the arbitrator shall follow these Terms and Materials, shall be bound to apply the applicable law and shall not rule inconsistently with the applicable law. The arbitration shall be conducted
                                    on an individual basis, and not as a consolidated, common, representative, group or class. The arbitrator shall include in his or her award any relief he or she deems proper in terms of money damages (with interest
